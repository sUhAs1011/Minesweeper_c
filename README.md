# Minesweeper_c

This was my third sem DSA(Data Structures and Applications) mini project. So this is the general minesweeper game present in the windows.
This game is made using linked list for traversing through the rows and columns, and rand() function is used in the game for placing the mines randomly. Similarly other functionalities are created accordingly for the game to work properly.
Any changes, please feel free to commit
